// This Genkit flow was for a Next.js backend.
// The Chrome extension blueprint specifies direct LLM calls via a Cloudflare Worker.
// The logic for constructing the prompt and parsing the response will be in:
// - proxy_worker/src/index.ts (for sending to LLM)
// - extension/src/service_worker/service_worker.ts (for parsing LLM response)
// This file can be removed or adapted if Genkit is used in the Cloudflare worker.
